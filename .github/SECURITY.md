# Security Policy

I take the security of my open-source projects seriously. If you believe you found a security vulnerability, please report it to me as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send me an email to <project-kirbyversions@lukasbestle.com>.

If you want to encrypt your message, you can use my PGP key:  
[`D703 9FD2 4AAE 69E9 97A6  92FF 2E2A DD32 FE50 61C1`](https://lukasbestle.com/pgp.asc)

I will get back to you as soon as possible. Please give me some time to fix the issue before publishing your findings (Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure).
